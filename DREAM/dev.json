Now this afternoon we'll go together on the walking tour of the city. And then on Wednesday afternoon, we are off to the legal sports center where you can play volleyball or football, use the gym, or go swimming to keep yourselves fit. And on Friday afternoon, we have a film club. This week's film is Spider Man. On Saturday, we are going on a day trip to Oxford, leaving here at 8:30 in the morning. Please don't be late, or we'll go without you. And finally on Sunday, we are off to London, leaving at the same time. If there are any other things you'd like to do while you are here, just ask me. And I will see if I can help.",

It is an excellent film for teachers to show their classes to explain global warming. It explains the facts very well, explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media, and is also pretty funny at times. The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already. This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this, and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together. I think it is a good film, but it is not perfect. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time. I was watching this to find out about global warming, not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election. I imagine that these are the bits that teachers' will have to skip when they show this to their classes, since they don't really add anything to the film. I would have respected Al Gore a bit more if he hadn't tried to make this a film about himself as well.",
