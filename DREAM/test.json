I mean the guy is huge, and he caught me dropping her at her place, and he nearly strangled me before I could get in my car. And the guy's dog. You might have warned me about his vicious beast dog. The thing nearly ripped off my arm. Well, once I peeled out of the drive way, the maniac started chasing me in his monster truck and nearly ran me off the road. And man, you could have told me that your car didn't have much gas 'cause it ran out in the middle of this dark parking lot, and I'm now hiding in the men's room of the gas station. Now, pick up the phone ... pick it up, ... Oh, no I can hear the guy outside and ... hey, and your phone is going dead ... Ah, man ... you might have told me that this thing couldn't hold a charge ... Ah man ... I should have stayed home and done the laundry ...

Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful. And now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before.",

That what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that. Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month. That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest. Also because people will sit down and say \"oh, here are my goals\" and forget all about them. Revisiting them every week is a good way. They stay at the top of your mind so you can take actions based on them.",
