Mostly when people say that they never dream, what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams or they don't think their dreams are important. The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams. When a person is hurt deep inside, when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad, if people turn off their dreams totally, it means they don't love themselves to even think about it.",

While waiting for my flights, I watch people passing by and start my imagination. For example, the other day, when I was waiting for my flight to Greece, I saw a couple. They were buying magazines at that moment. They were not wearing business clothes, but the man was carrying a suitcase. Every few seconds, the woman looked around. I wondered if someone was following them. Perhaps they were running away, and you know, this reminded me of a story in the newspaper that day: a bank clerk stole one million pounds a week before and disappeared with his wife. There was a picture of them in the paper. The couple really looked like the wiz. Maybe I should stop them. Just then, I saw them say goodbye to each other, and the woman walked away. Well, sometimes I make mistakes like that. But I find things like that are very useful for my writing.",

I was happy to hear that you two will be in town in January. I think that is the first time that you will have come to visit us after your marriage. Please do call me when you arrive so that I can pick you up at the station and then we may have dinner together in town. In case you don't have my number, it's 7807842. I look forward to meeting you soon. Yours, Tom.\"",

Every time a truck went by, I would shout a word that sounded like a track, but to everyone else, it sounded nothing like it. My parents tried to correct me, but failed. Then, about three months later, we traveled to New York, as we were waiting for our plane at the air?port. I looked out of a huge window, at that very moment I saw the largest truck in the world, I had to tell someone about this. I turned to my father who was standing next to about a thousand people waiting for the very flight and screamed \"Track! Track!\" My father tried hard to shut me up, but I was so excited, I kept screaming my special word. My poor mother decided she didn't know this baby and then ran into the ladies-room where she hid until I finally stopped. Well, I learned how to say truck correctly, and soon I was talking like a normal child. However, my parents will never forget the very first word I produced in my life.",

We see students individually, run group therapy sessions and courses of sessions as we think necessary. We are here to help with any problems? no matter how great or small, such as homesickness, relationship difficulties, death and separation, sexual problems, undue stress due to work and so on. You will not be the first to be homesick, find college life stressful, or decisions problematic. So please don't hesitate to come and have a chat if there is anything bothering you. This is a confidential service but we are willing to arrange with your course directors, your tutors, Student Union officers, career department or doctors. We can also put you in touch with outside counselling services. As a part of the university, all counselling is free of charge for full-time students. I know some of you may feel that seeing a counsellor has a stigma attached to it, but let me assure you even the best balanced individuals encounter situations where they need someone to talk with. So please don't hesitate. You're welcome to make use of this service. We hope you will enjoy your studies at the university. Thank you.",

I'm 24 years old, and uh, I graduated from high school about five years ago, and I'm the manager of an exotic pet shop. We carry all kinds of birds, and snakes, and spiders, and fish. We even have one snake that is about four meters long, but I keep him at home. And oh, yeah. Um, my hobbies. I fish, hunt, and ride horses in my free time. My favorite foods are beef, beef, and beef. I don't eat many vegetables, except potatoes with my beef. And, oh yeah, I sometimes eat apples and beef sometimes. I have two brothers. Both of them live with me because they don't have jobs, and my mom lives with me, and I have three dogs: Brutus, Charlie, and Samantha. Oh, and one more thing. This might seem strange, but I enjoy reading poetry. So, that's about it. I hope to hear from you. You can call me if you want. The number is 789-1350. Yeah, uh, right. Catch later, alligator.
